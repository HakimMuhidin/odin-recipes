this is my first project. 
i will create simple website with just html no css.
later when i learn more i will come back to this and make changes with css and even js if i remember it.

### a hour later
it didn't take long and it  went well i used mostly h4 and ul.  
it doesn't look that much appealing to the eye but it's enough i hope.
